# 🎉 Project: Fair-Mashup 🎯

**Duration**: Aug 2024 - Aug 2024

---

## 📌 Description

**Fair-Mashup** is a web-based tool designed to help you create fair and balanced Codeforces mashup contests. The unique feature? None of the participants in the contest will have solved or even attempted the selected problems before! 🔥

Whether you're a competitive programmer, a trainer, or simply someone who enjoys mashups, **Fair-Mashup** ensures fairness by selecting problems that match your chosen difficulty range and problem tags, ensuring a level playing field for all participants. Say goodbye to unfair advantages from previous attempts! 😉

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Go** 🐹: The backend of the application that handles data fetching and processing through the Codeforces API.
- **Gin** 🦸: A web framework for Go that aids in building the RESTful server for handling requests and responses.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** 🎨: The frontend built with these technologies for creating a responsive and interactive user interface.
- **No External Dependencies** 📦: The project avoids using external package managers (e.g., Node.js) and is built with native technologies for simplicity.
