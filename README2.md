# 🎉 Fair-Mashup 🎯

Welcome to **Fair-Mashup** – the ultimate tool for creating fair and balanced Codeforces mashup contests! 🎊

---

## 🌟 Project Overview

### Description
**Fair-Mashup** is a web-based tool designed to help you build Codeforces mashup contests with a unique feature: none of the participants will have solved or attempted the selected problems before! 🔥 Whether you're a competitive programmer, a trainer, or a fan of mashups, this tool ensures fair play by selecting problems that match your preferences in difficulty and tags.

### Key Features
- **Participant Filtering**: Filter problems based on users’ previous attempts or completions.
- **Problem Tags**: Choose problems by tags like *dp*, *graphs*, *greedy*, etc.
- **Difficulty Range**: Target problems within a specific difficulty range.
- **Problem Links**: Access unsolved problems directly on Codeforces with one click.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Go** 🐹 – Backend logic for data fetching and filtering.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** 🎨 – Frontend for inputting data and displaying results.
- **No external dependencies** 📦 – Built solely with native technologies for simplicity.
